The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) is an organization dedicated to advancing and promoting neuroinformatics globally. Neuroinformatics is a field that combines neuroscience with informatics, focusing on the organization, integration, and analysis of large amounts of data related to the brain and nervous system.

 The open-source parameter optimization software Neuroptimus was developed to enable easy application of advanced parameter optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence, to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms, including PCs and supercomputers.

## Project Description:
In this project, I've enhanced the parameter optimization software neuroptimus by integrating  inference-based algorithms such as  Bayesian inference using emcee, variational inference using pyvbmc, and likelihood-free methods (ABC) using abcpy's rejection sampling.

### Overview

#### i) Bayesian Inference using emcee: 

Bayesian inference allows for the estimation of model parameters by updating prior distributions with observed data, resulting in posterior distributions that reflect the likelihood of different parameter values. The emcee package implements the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which enables thorough exploration of the parameter space, providing robust estimates even in complex models with multiple parameters. This approach is particularly useful for quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates.

#### ii) Variational Inference using pyvbmc: 

Variational inference provides an efficient alternative to MCMC by approximating the posterior distribution through optimization. The pyvbmc tool (Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo) minimizes the divergence between the approximate and true posteriors, enabling faster convergence to the optimal solution. This method is advantageous in situations where computational speed is crucial, as it offers a quicker yet approximate solution compared to MCMC.

#### iv) Likelihood-Free Methods using ABC via abcpy: 

In scenarios where the likelihood function is intractable or difficult to compute, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) offers a solution. abcpy's rejection sampling technique enables parameter estimation without explicitly calculating the likelihood, making it suitable for complex models where traditional methods fall short. ABC compares observed data with data generated by the model, accepting parameter values that produce data close to the observations, thus bypassing the need for a fully specified likelihood function.
